1. **Your work style**: Remote workers might prioritize portability, while office workers might prefer comfort and ergonomics.

2. **Your role**: Developers often prefer mechanical keyboards for the tactile feedback, while designers might prioritize precision mice.

3. **Your commute**: Long commutes by bike or public transit favor backpacks, while driving or short walks suit messenger bags.
