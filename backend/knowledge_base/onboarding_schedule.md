3. **Build Relationships**: Schedule coffee chats with teammates and cross-functional partners.
4. **Be Patient**: It takes time to ramp up. Don't expect to know everything immediately.
5. **Speak Up**: Share your fresh perspective - new eyes often spot opportunities.

### Building Momentum

### Common New Hire Challenges

**Feeling Overwhelmed**: Totally normal! Focus on one thing at a time. You don't need to master everything in Week 1.

**Imposter Syndrome**: You were hired for a reason. Trust that you have valuable skills and perspectives to contribute.

**Information Overload**: Don't try to absorb everything immediately. Bookmark resources and return to them as needed.

**Not Knowing Who to Ask**: When in doubt, ask your onboarding buddy or post in #ask-anything. Everyone has been new before.
