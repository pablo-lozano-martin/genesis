# Orbio Company Culture and Values

At Orbio, we're building more than just software - we're building a workplace where people thrive. Our culture is rooted in our core values and reflected in how we work, communicate, and support each other every day.

## Our Mission

**To empower organizations with intelligent, intuitive software that transforms how people work.**

We believe technology should be a force multiplier for human potential. Our products help teams collaborate more effectively, make better decisions, and achieve their goals with less friction.

## Core Values

### 1. Customer Obsession

We start with the customer and work backwards. Every decision we make considers the impact on the people using our products.

**What this means in practice**:
- We regularly talk to customers and users to understand their needs
- Product decisions are grounded in user research and data
- We measure success by customer outcomes, not just features shipped
- Support tickets are opportunities to build trust and improve our product

### 2. Ownership and Accountability

We take responsibility for our work and its outcomes. We don't wait for someone else to solve problems - we step up.

**What this means in practice**:
- You're empowered to make decisions in your area of responsibility
- We assume good intent and trust each other's judgment
- Mistakes are learning opportunities, not reasons for blame
- We follow through on commitments and communicate proactively

### 3. Continuous Learning

We're curious, humble, and always improving. The best ideas can come from anywhere, and we're open to changing our minds with new information.

**What this means in practice**:
- We share knowledge through documentation, presentations, and mentoring
- Career development is a priority (backed by $2,500 annual learning budget)
- We run retrospectives to learn from successes and failures
- We celebrate experiments, even when they don't pan out

### 4. Bias for Action

We move quickly and iterate. Perfection is the enemy of progress.

**What this means in practice**:
- We ship early and often, gathering feedback to improve
- We make decisions with 70% of the information, not 100%
- Prototypes and MVPs help us test ideas quickly
- We're not afraid to pivot when we learn something new

### 5. Collaboration and Respect

Great work happens when diverse perspectives come together. We build trust by being transparent, respectful, and supportive.

**What this means in practice**:
- We debate ideas openly while respecting people
- Cross-functional collaboration is expected and valued
- We give and receive feedback with kindness and candor
- Work-life balance is respected - we support whole humans, not just workers

## Work Environment

### Office vs. Remote

Orbio supports flexible hybrid work. We believe:
- **In-person time builds relationships and culture**: Teams typically gather 2-3 days per week
- **Remote work enables deep focus**: Remote days are protected for focused, independent work
- **Flexibility is important**: Life happens - work with your manager on what works for you

**Typical Schedule**:
- **Core collaboration days**: Tuesday and Thursday (most meetings scheduled these days)
- **Flexible days**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (coordinate with your team)
- **All-hands meeting**: First Thursday of each month (in-person encouraged)

### Dress Code

**Business Casual to Casual** - dress for your day.

- **Office work**: Jeans and a nice shirt, casual dresses, comfortable but professional
- **Client meetings**: Business casual (collared shirt, slacks, dress, no need for suit)
- **Video calls**: Dress for your comfort, but consider your background and lighting
- **Team events**: Casual (jeans, t-shirts, sneakers)

**General guideline**: Dress in a way that makes you feel confident and comfortable. We're a professional environment, but we're not formal.

**Things to avoid**:
- Offensive or inappropriate graphics/text on clothing
- Overly revealing clothing
- Anything you'd be uncomfortable wearing to meet a client

When in doubt, look at what your teammates wear and match that level.

### Working Hours

**Core hours**: 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM (be available for meetings and collaboration)
**Flexible start/end**: Adjust your schedule to fit your life (early bird or night owl)
**Typical workday**: Most people work 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM with an hour lunch

**Expectations**:
- Keep your calendar updated so people can find time to meet
- Block focus time for deep work
- Be responsive during core hours (respond to Slack within a few hours)
- Respect others' time off - avoid messaging outside working hours unless urgent

**Overtime**: We don't expect or encourage long hours. Sustained overtime is a sign of under-staffing or poor planning, not dedication.

## Communication Norms

### Slack Etiquette

Slack is our primary communication tool. Use it effectively:

**Do**:
- Use public channels for conversations others might benefit from
- Use threads to keep discussions organized
- React with emoji to acknowledge messages (saves "got it!" replies)
- Set status when you're away, in a meeting, or focused
- Use Do Not Disturb for focused work time

**Don't**:
- Send "Hey, can we talk?" without context (just ask your question!)
- Expect instant responses - people need focus time
- @channel or @here unless it's truly urgent and relevant to everyone
- Send sensitive information in Slack (use 1Password for passwords, email for sensitive topics)

**Response Time Expectations**:
- **Urgent**: Within 1 hour (use @mention and mark as urgent)
- **Normal**: Within 4 hours during work hours
- **FYI**: No response needed (use emoji reaction to acknowledge)

### Email

Email is for:
- External communication (clients, partners, vendors)
- Formal documentation (policy changes, important announcements)
- Sensitive topics (HR issues, performance feedback)
- Long-form communication that needs careful review

Use Slack for internal, real-time communication.

### Meetings

**Good Meeting Practices**:
- Send agenda in advance (at least 1 hour before)
- Start and end on time
- Assign a note-taker and action items
- Record meetings for people who can't attend
- Default to 25 or 50 minutes (leave time between meetings)

**Before Scheduling a Meeting**:
- Could this be a Slack thread or email instead?
- Are all invitees necessary?
- Is the outcome clear?

**Meeting-Free Time**:
- **Wednesdays**: No-meeting day for focused work (exceptions: all-hands, critical client meetings)
- **Before 10:00 AM and after 4:00 PM**: Avoid scheduling meetings unless necessary

### Feedback Culture

We give feedback early and often to help each other grow.

**Giving Feedback**:
- Be specific and actionable
- Focus on behavior, not personality
- Assume good intent
- Offer suggestions, not just criticism
- Give positive feedback publicly, constructive feedback privately

**Receiving Feedback**:
- Listen without defensiveness
- Ask clarifying questions
- Thank the person for caring enough to share
- Reflect before responding
- You don't have to agree, but consider the perspective

**Regular Feedback Loops**:
- Weekly or bi-weekly 1-on-1s with manager
- Quarterly performance reviews
- 360 reviews twice per year
- Real-time feedback encouraged in Slack or in person

## Team Collaboration

### How We Build Products

**Product Development Process**:
1. **Discovery**: User research, problem definition, market analysis
2. **Design**: Mockups, prototypes, user testing
3. **Planning**: Break work into stories, estimate effort, prioritize
4. **Development**: Build in 2-week sprints with daily standups
5. **QA and Testing**: Automated tests, manual testing, bug fixes
6. **Launch**: Staged rollout, monitoring, customer feedback
7. **Iteration**: Gather data, learn, improve

**Cross-Functional Teams**:
Product teams include engineers, designers, product managers, and data analysts working together on shared goals.

### Decision-Making

**Ownership Model**:
- Every decision has an owner (the person accountable)
- Owner gathers input from stakeholders
- Owner makes the final call and communicates the decision
- We disagree and commit - once decided, we move forward together

**Types of Decisions**:
- **One-way doors** (irreversible): Discuss thoroughly, involve leadership
- **Two-way doors** (reversible): Move quickly, iterate based on feedback

### Code Review and Quality

For engineering teams:

**Code Review Standards**:
- All code requires review from at least one teammate
- Reviews focus on: functionality, readability, tests, performance, security
- Be kind in reviews - we're all learning
- Approve quickly if minor comments - don't block on style nits

**Quality Bar**:
- Write tests for new features
- Keep technical debt manageable
- Document complex logic
- Follow team style guides
- Monitor production for errors
